# generate-functions-in-go

    This is not a comprehensive generator for functions.
    Its purpose is to provide an example of generating functions
    for any go data types from just one generator function.
    Adjust the numbers slice to generate functions for fewer/more types.
    To generate different functions, adjust the funcSlice and add new functions (see the existing functions to get an idea).
    A full file's worth of content is written to standard output.
